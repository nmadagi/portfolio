            When I joined Liberty & Freedom Legal Group, a donor-advised nonprofit, the organization was facing increasing volatility in its investment returns due to rising interest rates. Partnering closely with the CEO, I initiated a strategic overhaul—identifying higher-margin service opportunities that ultimately led to a 30% increase in profitability. But what drew me in most was the challenge of protecting long-term fund value amid financial uncertainty.
<br><br>
I designed and implemented interest rate hedging strategies for our donor-advised funds, which helped stabilize returns and preserve our grantmaking capacity. Managing nearly $15M in funds independently, I was responsible for ensuring every process adhered to regulatory and operational standards. I also developed financial models to project performance and proactively detect risks.
<br><br>
To support portfolio oversight, I built automated Python tools to monitor exposure across $30M+ in donor assets, aligning reporting with both IRS guidelines and internal risk frameworks. This hands-on experience deepened my passion for managing financial risk in mission-driven environments.

            My time at Subhas Patil & Co. marked the beginning of my focused journey into risk management. Tasked with daily oversight of client portfolios totaling over $20M in assets, I became immersed in the practical application of market, credit, and interest rate risk assessments.
            <br><br>
Driven by curiosity, I took it further developing Value-at-Risk (VaR) models and a custom stress testing framework that enhanced the firm’s risk scenario coverage by 40%. These tools became essential in weekly investment committee meetings, where I presented dashboards that helped shape tactical decisions.
<br><br>
What fascinated me most was how data anomalies in FX risk could distort exposure metrics. To resolve this, I designed a machine learning solution in Python that automated anomaly detection, cutting down manual review time by over 80%. It was during this role that I realized I was not just interested in reporting risk—I wanted to build the systems that manage and mitigate it.

            <br>
            At Cognizant, I transitioned from engineering to financial risk through a technical lens. I worked directly with quant analysts to convert complex risk models into production-grade systems. A major focus was building robust ETL pipelines for ingesting market, trade, and counterparty data—critical inputs for real-time risk analytics.
            <br><br>
One of the biggest challenges I solved was reducing the deployment time of new risk models. By implementing CI/CD pipelines, we brought it down from 3 weeks to just 3 days, enabling faster adaptation to changing market conditions. I also integrated our risk infrastructure with front-office and reporting platforms using APIs and Kafka, ensuring consistency and speed across the firm’s systems.
<br><br>
This was the first time I saw how crucial infrastructure is to effective risk management—and how engineering, when aligned with quantitative insight, could be a powerful tool in mitigating financial exposure.

            <br>
            Starting out in the Quant Risk Team, I was tasked with optimizing stress testing and scenario analysis workflows that had become bottlenecks during market events. I overhauled our data ingestion and compute routines, cutting runtime from 8 hours to less than 3. This directly impacted the speed at which our risk team could respond to market shifts.
            <br><br>
Recognizing the need for system stability, I built automated monitoring scripts to detect model execution failures in real-time, which reduced operational downtime and ensured timely reporting.
<br><br>
Though my role was technical, every problem I solved revealed another layer of risk dynamics in financial systems. These early challenges fueled my desire to pursue risk management not only as a technical domain but as a decision-making discipline at the intersection of finance and technology.
